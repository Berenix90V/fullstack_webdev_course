## Problems with proxy
Due to problems with the proxy options, I've installed http-proxy-middleware and set it up following the official guide:
https://create-react-app.dev/docs/proxying-api-requests-in-development/, https://xerosource.com/using-http-proxy-middleware-reactjs/.

Install http-proxy-middleware, created file `setupProxy.js` and set `proxy: http://localhost:3000`
